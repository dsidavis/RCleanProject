Get rid of lists in the data frames.
  Seem to be all related to stan and packages we haven't loaded.

Find orphan files
  see rendundant.R and redundantFiles.R

[done] Evaluate library() calls.
  With user control via loadPackages = TRUE/FALSE

[simple case] Deal with variables in calls to read.csv(), etc. i.e. where the name of the file is in a variable.
    getDepends(system.file("sampleScripts", "eg1.R", package = "RCleanProject")

Looping over a vector of file names and calling ...
  lapply(files, read.csv)
  for(f in files)
     read.csv(f)



Partially done:

Nested calls
  See
     getDepends("~/DSIProjects/MattCleanProject/RCleanProject/inst/sampleScripts/eg_nested.R")

  filename operation expressionNum
1  foo.csv  read.csv             1
2  bar.csv  read.csv             2


[fixed] if() with else with multiple expressions within { }
  Preserve the subexpression numbers as a hierarchy

Top-level if() statements
  find constant and exclude if FALSE
  Allow for constant that could be redefined.
  Dynamic value.

  filename operation expressionNum
1 foo2.csv  read.csv             2
2  bar.csv  read.csv             4
