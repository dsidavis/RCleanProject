# RCleanProject
R code to analyze and clean code in an evolving project to identify redundant code, dependencies,
etc.
This also helps one become familiar with an existing collection of code, data and output files.



Suppose we keep separate steps of an analysis in different files. How do we know which 
to run first? i.e. the order to source() them.
How can we run just the minimal set of files to get the output we want.
This is purpose of CodeDepends and it almost does it. 
The code here adds a few more steps.
