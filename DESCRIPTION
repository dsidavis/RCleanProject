Title: Analyze Code in Scripts to Query and Display Code Content, Identify Dependencies, Orphans, ...
Description: Understanding code one inherits, or what files, functions and scripts are actually used in your
 own slowly evolving project can be very useful. To create a minimal set of data files, code files, functions, plots, etc.
 so that others can reproduce your work is necessary for enabling reviewers (journal or code) to efficiently
 understand the code.  This package also helps people become familiar with other people's code.
 This currently works on scripts but is very easily adapted to Sweave, XML, Markdown, knitr, JSS, iPython/Jupyter documents.
 This uses static analysis to understand the dependencies.
 We plan on extending this to shell scripts, understanding Makefiles, and also programmatically generating Makefiles
 from the dependencies.
